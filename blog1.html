            Harry felt something, or rather someone, pulling off his silvery cloak, and just a few moments later, Ginny
            Weasely was
            standing in front of him.
            “Your footprints are <i>irregular</i>," she explained jokingly, sitting down next to him on the wooden
            bench.<br><br>
            Harry could
            always count on a Weasley to lighten up the mood.
            Harry had so much to say to her. He wanted to tell her how sorry he was for everything. How much he missed
            her
            and
            thought of her. He wanted to tell her all the stories of everything that had happened in the past months,.
            However, all
            that escaped his lips was, “I'm sorry... about Fred”.<br><br>
            With a hint of pain in her fierce eyes, she responded, “I know. I’m sure he’s off making all kinds of
            mayhem up
            in
            wizarding heaven, though, wherever that is. Probably setting off dungbombs in every direction.” A kind of
            strained,
            tainted laugh makes it out of her body. She’s so strong, Harry thought, even in the midst of war and
            wreckage.
            That’s
            what he liked most about her.
            “So, do you know what you’re going to do?”she asked.<br><br>
            “About what?”<br><br>
            “To get your sister back. You’ve been thinking about it, haven’t you?”<br><br>
            “Yeah, I don’t know. The only place I can think of that she could be at is Malfoy Manor, but chances are
            they’ve
            probably left by now. They must know the ministry will be after them soon”.<br><br>
            “What are we waiting for! Let’s go there now, see if we can intercept them," Ginny responded, with a
            determined finality.<br><br>
            Before Harry could respond, Hermione, Ron, Neville, and Luna came running up to them.<br><br>
            “We’ve been looking all over for you Harry!!!", a breathless Hermione started.<br><br>
            “Yeah mate," Ron agreed, “We had to find out from <i>Luna</i>,'' he nods in Luna’s direction, “that you just
            murdered
            Voldemort, AND, that you have a Death Eater sister! A Death Eater sister!”.<br><br>
            ‘Yeah, well suit up,” Ginny started, “we’re going to Malfoy Manor. We think she could be there”.<br><br>
            “Wait, no guys,'' Harry stated before his friends had a chance to react, “I’m going, alone. I can’t put you
            all in danger anymore. You’ve been loads of help already. Let me handle this one”.<br><br>
            “Harry, haven’t we been through this already!", Hermione exclaimed, exasperated. “We’re going, and that’s
            final.” Ron, Neville, Luna, and Ginny all nodded their heads vigorously. <br><br>
            “Wow, she can be crazy!” Ron exclaimed. This earned him a shove from Hermione before he added, “But she's
            also crazy right mate. We’re going whether you like it or not.”<br><br>
            “We better get going then, before they’re gone'' Hermione said.
            With that, the 6 of them walked to the edge of the school grounds and disapparated, ready to start their new
            adventure which, unbeknownst to them, would forever change their lives.

            Harry felt the land come beneath his feet as the whirling stopped. Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna
            soon
            landed
            by his side.
            “Wow, still haven’t gotten used to that feeling again after being locked inside Hogwarts for 9 months!,"
            Neville
            announced.
            No one laughed.<br><br>
            As the teens took in their surroundings, they found that a large, 3-story, tan, ghostly building was in
            front of
            them:
            The Malfoy Manor. And before it, was an unwelcoming, but seemingly open gate!
            “They must have been leaving in quite a hurry," Ron concluded.<br><br>
            “No," Hermione responded. “I bet they’re just doing this to lure us in. They must have some traps set up in
            there. We
            have to be careful. Let’s stick together”.<br><br>
            So with that, they walked slowly towards the house, hoping no surprising traps awaited them inside.
            “Specialis Revelio," Hermione chanted, followed by a recitation of “Homenum Revelio”.<br><br>

            Nothing. No one.<br><br>

            “I don’t understand!," she announced. “How could they have left no traps, no protective defenses. No
            nothing!”.
            Harry felt a sinking feeling in his chest as he absorbed the truth. His sister wasn’t there. No one
            was.<br><br>
            “I’m really sorry Harry,'' Luna started. Having lost her Mother completely at a young age, she understood
            Harry's
            feelings more than any of his other friends.<br><br>
            “Maybe there is something inside," Neville contributed. “A clue to where she could have gone”.<br><br>
            “Maybe," Ginny responded. “It’s worth a try, Harry. Let’s just stick together in case there's some
            undetectable
            enchantment”.<br><br>
            With that, the young wizards cautiously entered the mansion.

            <br><br>
            <hr><br><br>

            It appeared as if the Malfoy's not only had been there, but also it was quite apparent to the 6 that the
            family
            had left
            in an extreme hurry. The door had been left ajar, the...
